# Email Templates

Emails were sent to authors who did not disclose enough code/data for their work to be replicable. Authors were also separated into Informed and Uninformed groups.

## Legend

Each email contains portions which were substituted depending on the article and sender. These are defined here:

* `<Corresponding Author>`: The corresponding author on the article of interest
* `<Article Title>`: The title of the article of interest
* `<Sender>`: The name of the sender
* `<Article Specific Text>`: Each article was read and an article specific paragraph requesting relavant code/data was created. This is substituted here.
* `<Previous Email>`: The email sent to this corresponding author earlier
* `<Previous Subject>`: The subject of the previous email sent to this corresponding author.

### Uninformed Group

```
